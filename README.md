# S3 For All

S3 For All is a simple and lightweight plugin for Obsidian that allows you to upload notes to the S3 repository with a single button/command

## Background

I originally wrote the plugin for my other project, Tech Journal. This is the site where I will keep my MD-blog. While working out how this site would work, I came across the fact that I don't know how to upload MD notes to S3 in a convenient way. At that moment I found Obsidian - the best (in my opinion) tool for taking notes. Obsidian is on all platforms and supports syncing via iCloud, making it perfect for my purposes!

Before that, I wanted to write a telegram bot for my tasks, but then I decided to just make a plugin for Obsidian.

Thanks to the Obsidian community for helping with development ‚ù§Ô∏è
